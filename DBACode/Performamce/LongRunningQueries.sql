/*
- Sort by Avg Worker Time → top CPU burners.
- Sort by Avg Logical Reads → likely index/design fixes.
- Sort by Avg Elapsed → long runners; check if elapsed >> worker (waits).
- Scan flags (Spill Warn / Implicit Conv / Key Lookups / UDFs) and open the plan for the worst offenders.
- Look at Max vs Min elapsed for variance → parameter sniffing candidates.
- Check Creation Time for “new & hot” patterns.

- Execution Count:			how many times the query has run since plan compiled; high counts = “death by a thousand cuts.”
- Total Logical Reads (MB):	total data read from cache; very high totals = IO pressure from frequent queries.
- Avg Logical Reads (MB):	average data read per execution; high averages = scans, missing indexes, or wide rows.
- Total Worker Time (ms):	total CPU consumed; high totals = cumulative CPU hogs.
- Avg Worker Time (ms):		average CPU per run; high averages = CPU-bound query, check for UDFs, scalar ops, bad joins.
- Total Elapsed Time (ms):	total wall-clock run time; high totals = overall workload impact.
- Avg Elapsed Time (ms):	average run time; if much greater than Avg Worker Time → wait issues (IO, blocking, memory).

- Spill To Temp DB:			Query spilled to tempdb (possible memory grant issue
- Impicit Conversions:		May prevent index usage
- Impicit Conversions Alt:	Scalar operator
- Key Lookups: Potential	missing covering index
- UDF Is In Plan:			Row-by-row overhead due to UDF
